# CMSIS

## Introduction

* `CMSIS` is a vendor-independent `hardware abstraction layer (HAL)` for microcontrollers that are based on Arm® Cortex® processors. 

* `CMSIS` defines generic tool interfaces and enables consistent device support. 

* `CMSIS` software interfaces simplify software re-use, reduce the learning curve for microcontroller developers, and improve time to market for new devices.

* `CMSIS` provides interfaces to processor and peripherals, real-time operating systems, and middleware components. 

* `CMSIS` includes a delivery mechanism for devices, boards, and software and enables the combination of software components from multiple vendors
