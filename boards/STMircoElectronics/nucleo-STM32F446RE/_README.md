# STM32F446RE - Nucleo

* The STM32F446xC/E devices are based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 180 MHz. 

* The Cortex-M4 core features a floating point unit (FPU) single precision supporting all Arm® single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. 

* It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) that enhances application security.
